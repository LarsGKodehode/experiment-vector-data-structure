# Vector Data Structures

This is repository is just me experimenting and exploring a more spatially approach to data layouts.

Information can be thought of as points, or shapes, in some n-dimensional space.
Which implies that querries can be treated in a similar manner as spatial questions.

- Is this data point within x meter of this other data point?
- How close are these two data points?
- What are the data points within this radius of this location?
- If we take this path here what would we see? And in what sequence?

## Examples

TODO!
Write down some examples of

- 1-dimensional to N-dimensional
- Point based querries
- Path based querries
- Realworld applicationst
